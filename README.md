# kitten_vote_tracker
My approach is to start by outlining the function flow of my project.
To begin I will create a new project using the skeleton framework, then I will pseudocode the javascript needed...
-first, start by checking to see if we have saved data and loading it if so
-next, if we dont have pre-existing data saved we should create our photo objects and their properties
-then we proceed to randomly generate two non-equal numbers and use those numbers to select two photos from our photos list
-once we have our photos we want to display them and allow the user to vote by clicking on them
-After our user clicks on a photo to cast their vote we want to showcase the winner in some fashion(css/jquery most likely)
-finally we need functionality to start the whole entire process over and yet we need to make sure our photos for the next round have not been shown recently.

After coding the flow into a js file I will change my css properties to enhance the user experience.
